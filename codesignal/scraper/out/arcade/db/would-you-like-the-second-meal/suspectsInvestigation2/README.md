<p>A large amount of money was stolen today from the main city bank, and as the chief of police it's your duty to find the robber.</p>
<p>You store information about your suspects in the table <strong>Suspect</strong>, which has the structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>id</code>: unique suspect id;</li>
<li><code>name</code>: suspect first name;</li>
<li><code>surname</code>: suspect surname;</li>
<li><code>height</code>: suspect height;</li>
<li><code>weight</code>: suspect weight.</li>
</ul>
<p>You have already gathered some evidence and discovered the following clues:</p>
<ul>
<li>according to the camera records, the robber is taller than <code>170cm</code>;</li>
<li>the robber left their signature near the crime scene: <code>"B. Gre?n"</code>. <code>"B"</code> definitely stands for the first letter of robber's name, and <code>"Gre?n"</code> is their surname. The <code>4<sup>th</sup></code> letter of the surname is smudged by ketchup and is unreadable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The clues you've obtained allow you to let some suspects go since they can't possibly be guilty, so now you need to build a list that contains the people who can be freed based on the gathered information. For each of these people, you need to know his/her <code>id</code>, <code>name</code> and <code>surname</code>. Please note that the information obtained from the clue should be considered case-insensitive, so for example <code>"bill Green"</code>, <code>"Bill GrEeN"</code>, and <code>"Bill Green"</code> should all be included in the new table.</p>
<p>Given the table <strong>Suspect</strong>, build the resulting table as follows: the table should have columns <code>id</code>, <code>name</code> and <code>surname</code> and its values should be ordered by the suspects' <code>id</code>s in ascending order.</p>
<p><span class="markdown--header" style="color:#2b3b52;font-size:1.4em">Example</span></p>
<p>For the following table of <strong>Suspect</strong></p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>id</th>
    <th>name</th>
    <th>surname</th>
    <th>height</th>
    <th>weight</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>John</td>
    <td>Doe</td>
    <td>165</td>
    <td>60</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Bill</td>
    <td>Green</td>
    <td>170</td>
    <td>67</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>Baelfire</td>
    <td>Grehn</td>
    <td>172</td>
    <td>70</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>Bill</td>
    <td>Gretan</td>
    <td>185</td>
    <td>55</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>Brendon</td>
    <td>Grewn</td>
    <td>180</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>bill</td>
    <td>Green</td>
    <td>172</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>the output should be</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>id</td>
<td>name</td>
<td>surname</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>John</td>
<td>Doe</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Bill</td>
<td>Green</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Bill</td>
<td>Gretan</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The <code>1<sup>st</sup></code> and the <code>2<sup>nd</sup></code> suspects are not taller than <code>170cm</code>, and the <code>4<sup>th</sup></code> suspect's surname doesn't match the <code>"Gre?n"</code> pattern, so these suspects can't be guilty.</p>
